## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m an NLP (Natural Language Processing) researcher focused on exploring and developing models for deep text understanding using BERT and other transformer-based architectures. This space serves as a home for my research projects, experiments, and implementations centered around advancing machine understanding of human language.

My work involves investigating how large language models can be fine-tuned and adapted for a range of NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, named entity recognition, and text classification. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how transformers, with their attention mechanisms and contextual embeddings, enable more nuanced and accurate language comprehension compared to traditional approaches.

This repository includes a variety of projectsâ€”from pretraining and fine-tuning experiments to data preprocessing pipelines and evaluation tools. I work extensively with libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, and I place a strong emphasis on reproducibility, modularity, and clean code.

Alongside the code, youâ€™ll often find detailed README files, training logs, and notebooks with insights and visualizations to help others understand the rationale behind different model choices and configurations. Whether the focus is on improving accuracy, reducing model size, or analyzing attention weights, each project contributes to a broader understanding of how NLP models behave and perform in real-world scenarios.

If youâ€™re a fellow researcher, practitioner, or enthusiast in the field of NLP, I invite you to explore, contribute, or connect. Collaboration and open discussion are key to advancing the field, and Iâ€™m always open to feedback and shared learning.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find the work here informative and inspiring as we continue to push the boundaries of what language models can achieve.
